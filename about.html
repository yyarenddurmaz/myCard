      <h2>About Me!</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from Istanbul Kültür University, Department of
        Mathematics-Computer Sciences. I once worked as a volunteer in a youth
        organization called AIESEC. I participated in some volunteer programs
        provided by my university. I took on various duties at my school when
        necessary. I'm learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript. At the same time, I am
        improving my English and learning Spanish. I studied Search Engine
        Optimization in my graduation thesis. I aim to advance my career in the
        Front-End field.
